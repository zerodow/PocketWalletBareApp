# Task 4: Audio Recording Implementation

## Overview

Implement the actual audio recording functionality using react-native-voice. This task connects the UI components to the underlying voice recording capabilities and handles the recording lifecycle.

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement actual audio recording using react-native-voice
- [ ] Handle recording start/stop/cancel operations
- [ ] Add audio permissions handling
- [ ] Basic recording state management
- [ ] Test recording functionality on physical device

## Acceptance Criteria

### Recording Functionality

- Audio recording starts when user initiates
- Recording stops on user command or timeout
- Audio data captured and available for processing
- Recording cancellation properly cleans up resources
- Multiple recording sessions handled correctly

### Permission Management

- Microphone permissions requested before recording
- Permission denial handled gracefully
- Settings redirect for permission management
- Permission status checked and updated
- Clear user messaging for permission states

### State Management

- Recording state synchronized across components
- Proper cleanup of recording resources
- Error states handled and reported
- Recording duration tracking
- Memory management for audio data

## Priority

High

## Process

0%

## Estimated Time

6-8 hours

## Dependencies

- Task 1: Project Setup & Dependencies completed
- Task 2: Voice Button Component completed
- Task 3: Voice Recording Modal completed
- Physical device for testing (recording doesn't work in simulator)

## Libraries to Install

- None (react-native-voice already installed in Task 1)

## Implementation Details

### 1) Voice Recording Service

- **Recording Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface VoiceRecordingService {
    startRecording(): Promise<void>;
    stopRecording(): Promise<string>;
    cancelRecording(): Promise<void>;
    isRecording(): boolean;
    hasPermission(): Promise<boolean>;
    requestPermission(): Promise<boolean>;
  }

  interface RecordingResult {
    transcript: string;
    confidence: number;
    duration: number;
    error?: string;
  }
  ```

### 2) Permission Management System

- **Permission States**:
  - Not requested
  - Pending request
  - Granted
  - Denied
  - Restricted (iOS)

- **Permission Handling Flow**:
  - Check current permission status
  - Request permission if needed
  - Handle permission responses
  - Provide fallback for denied permissions

### 3) Recording State Management

- **State Machine**:
  ```
  Idle → Requesting Permission → Ready → Recording → Processing → Complete/Error
  ```

- **State Synchronization**:
  - Central recording state store
  - Component state updates
  - Callback notifications
  - Error propagation

## Development Workflow

### Before Starting
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/audio-recording-implementation`
2. Start development work

### When Complete
1. Commit changes with descriptive messages
2. Push branch to remote repository
3. Create PR targeting `dev` branch
4. Add comprehensive PR description

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Voice Recording Service

1. **Create VoiceRecordingService**:
   ```typescript
   import Voice from '@react-native-voice/voice';

   export class VoiceRecordingService {
     private static instance: VoiceRecordingService;
     private recording = false;
     private listeners: Array<(state: RecordingState) => void> = [];

     public static getInstance(): VoiceRecordingService {
       if (!this.instance) {
         this.instance = new VoiceRecordingService();
       }
       return this.instance;
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Recording Methods**:
   - startRecording: Initialize voice recognition
   - stopRecording: End recording and get results
   - cancelRecording: Cancel recording and cleanup
   - Error handling for each method

3. **Add Event Listeners**:
   ```typescript
   Voice.onSpeechStart = this.onSpeechStart;
   Voice.onSpeechEnd = this.onSpeechEnd;
   Voice.onSpeechResults = this.onSpeechResults;
   Voice.onSpeechError = this.onSpeechError;
   ```

### Phase 2: Permission Handling

4. **Permission Management**:
   ```typescript
   import { PermissionsAndroid, Platform } from 'react-native';

   async hasPermission(): Promise<boolean> {
     if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
       return PermissionsAndroid.check(
         PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.RECORD_AUDIO
       );
     }
     // iOS permission handling
     return Voice.isAvailable();
   }
   ```

5. **Permission Request Flow**:
   - Check current permission status
   - Request permission with proper messaging
   - Handle different permission responses
   - Provide settings redirect for denied permissions

6. **Permission UI Integration**:
   - Update button states based on permissions
   - Show permission request dialogs
   - Handle permission denied states
   - Provide clear user messaging

### Phase 3: Component Integration

7. **VoiceButton Integration**:
   ```typescript
   const handleVoiceButtonPress = async () => {
     const hasPermission = await voiceService.hasPermission();
     if (!hasPermission) {
       const granted = await voiceService.requestPermission();
       if (!granted) {
         // Handle permission denied
         return;
       }
     }

     setModalVisible(true);
     await voiceService.startRecording();
   };
   ```

8. **VoiceInputModal Integration**:
   - Connect recording state to modal UI
   - Handle recording start/stop from modal
   - Update visual feedback based on recording state
   - Error handling and user feedback

9. **State Synchronization**:
   - Central state management for recording
   - Component state updates
   - Error state propagation
   - Cleanup on component unmount

### Phase 4: Error Handling & Testing

10. **Error Handling**:
    - Network connectivity errors
    - Microphone hardware issues
    - Permission denied scenarios
    - Recording timeout handling
    - Recovery and retry mechanisms

11. **Testing Implementation**:
    - Test on physical iOS/Android devices
    - Verify permission flows work correctly
    - Test recording in various environments
    - Verify cleanup and memory management

12. **Performance Optimization**:
    - Minimize recording latency
    - Optimize memory usage during recording
    - Handle background/foreground transitions
    - Battery usage optimization
