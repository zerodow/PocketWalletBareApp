# Task 3: Voice Recording Modal

## Overview

Create the VoiceInputModal component that provides the recording interface when users tap the voice button. This modal will handle the visual feedback during recording and provide controls for start/stop/cancel operations.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create VoiceInputModal.tsx with recording interface
- [ ] Implement start/stop recording controls
- [ ] Add basic visual feedback (pulse animation or simple indicator)
- [ ] Handle modal open/close states
- [ ] Basic error handling for permissions and recording failures

## Acceptance Criteria

### Modal Functionality

- Full-screen overlay modal with dark background
- Start/stop recording controls prominently displayed
- Cancel button to dismiss without saving
- Modal state management (open/closed/recording)
- Proper modal lifecycle and cleanup

### Visual Feedback

- Large visual indicator for recording state
- Real-time recording feedback (pulse/waveform animation)
- Recording timer display
- Clear call-to-action text and instructions
- Loading state during processing

### User Experience

- Smooth modal animations (slide up/fade in)
- Intuitive control placement and sizing
- Clear visual hierarchy and information
- Accessible design with proper labels
- Error state handling with user-friendly messages

## Priority

## Implementation Details

### 1) Modal Structure & Props

- **VoiceInputModal Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface VoiceInputModalProps {
    visible: boolean;
    onClose: () => void;
    onRecordingStart: () => void;
    onRecordingStop: () => void;
    onRecordingCancel: () => void;
    isRecording?: boolean;
    isProcessing?: boolean;
    recordingDuration?: number;
    error?: string;
  }

  interface ModalState {
    recordingTime: number;
    animationValue: Animated.Value;
    isVisible: boolean;
  }
  ```

### 2) Visual Design System

- **Layout Structure**:
  - Full-screen modal overlay
  - Centered content area with recording controls
  - Dark semi-transparent background
  - Large recording indicator area
  - Control buttons at bottom

- **Recording Indicator**:
  - Large circular pulse animation
  - Amplitude-based sizing (future enhancement)
  - Color changes based on recording state
  - Timer display prominently shown

### 3) Animation Implementation

- **Modal Animations**:
  - Slide up from bottom entrance
  - Fade in background overlay
  - Scale animation for recording indicator
  - Smooth transitions between states

- **Recording Feedback**:
  - Continuous pulse animation while recording
  - Scale and opacity changes
  - Color transitions for different states
  - Timer counting animation

## Development Workflow

### Before Starting
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/voice-recording-modal`
2. Start development work

### When Complete
1. Commit changes with descriptive messages
2. Push branch to remote repository
3. Create PR targeting `dev` branch
4. Add comprehensive PR description

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Modal Structure

1. **Create Modal Component**:
   ```typescript
   export const VoiceInputModal: React.FC<VoiceInputModalProps> = ({
     visible,
     onClose,
     onRecordingStart,
     onRecordingStop,
     onRecordingCancel,
     isRecording,
     isProcessing,
     recordingDuration,
     error
   }) => {
     // Modal implementation
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Modal Container**:
   - Full-screen overlay with proper z-index
   - Dark background with opacity
   - Content area with proper sizing
   - Safe area handling for different devices

3. **Add Basic Layout**:
   - Header area with title and close button
   - Center area for recording indicator
   - Bottom area for control buttons
   - Error message area

### Phase 2: Recording Interface

4. **Recording Indicator**:
   ```typescript
   const $recordingIndicator: ThemedStyle<ViewStyle> = ({ colors }) => ({
     width: 120,
     height: 120,
     borderRadius: 60,
     backgroundColor: colors.error,
     alignItems: 'center',
     justifyContent: 'center',
   })
   ```

5. **Timer Implementation**:
   - Format recording duration (mm:ss)
   - Update timer every second during recording
   - Reset timer on modal close/cancel
   - Display timer prominently

6. **Control Buttons**:
   - Large start/stop button (primary action)
   - Cancel button (secondary action)
   - Disabled states when appropriate
   - Proper button sizing and spacing

### Phase 3: Animations & Polish

7. **Modal Animations**:
   ```typescript
   const slideAnimation = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;

   useEffect(() => {
     Animated.timing(slideAnimation, {
       toValue: visible ? 1 : 0,
       duration: 300,
       useNativeDriver: true,
     }).start();
   }, [visible]);
   ```

8. **Recording Pulse Animation**:
   - Continuous scaling animation
   - Opacity changes for breathing effect
   - Color transitions for recording state
   - Performance optimized animations

9. **State Transitions**:
   - Smooth transitions between idle/recording/processing
   - Loading indicators during processing
   - Success/error state animations
   - Proper cleanup on unmount

### Phase 4: Integration & Error Handling

10. **Error Handling**:
    - Display error messages clearly
    - Handle recording failures gracefully
    - Permission error specific messaging
    - Retry mechanisms where appropriate

11. **Modal Integration**:
    - Connect to VoiceButton component
    - Handle modal visibility state
    - Proper callback integration
    - State synchronization

12. **Accessibility**:
    - Screen reader support
    - Proper ARIA labels
    - Keyboard navigation support
    - High contrast mode compatibility
