# Task: Voice Input for Transactions

**Task ID:** Post-MVP-Epic1-Voice
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Pending
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

---

## üìã Overview

Implement voice input functionality that allows users to record audio and automatically populate transaction data using speech-to-text and intelligent parsing.

## üéØ Goals

- **Primary**: Reduce transaction entry time from ‚â§10s to ‚â§5s using voice input
- **Secondary**: Support Vietnamese language voice commands
- **Tertiary**: Maintain offline-first approach with graceful fallbacks

## üìù User Stories

### Story 1: Basic Voice Recording
**As a** user
**I want to** tap a voice button and speak my transaction
**So that** I can quickly add transactions without manual typing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Voice button is prominently displayed on QuickAddScreen
- [ ] Tapping button opens voice recording modal
- [ ] Recording shows visual feedback (waveform/amplitude)
- [ ] Stop recording automatically processes audio

### Story 2: Speech-to-Text Processing
**As a** user
**I want to** speak "spent 50 ngh√¨n for lunch at restaurant yesterday"
**So that** the app fills amount=50000, type=expense, category=food, note="lunch at restaurant", date=yesterday

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Converts Vietnamese speech to text accurately
- [ ] Parses amount from speech (supports "ngh√¨n", "tri·ªáu" currency units)
- [ ] Detects transaction type from keywords ("spent", "received", "bought", "added")
- [ ] Extracts category hints from keywords
- [ ] Parses optional date/time expressions ("yesterday", "this morning")
- [ ] Populates transaction form fields automatically

### Story 3: Smart Parsing & Validation
**As a** user
**I want to** review and edit voice-parsed data before saving
**So that** I can correct any errors from speech recognition

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Shows parsed data in preview before applying
- [ ] Allows editing of all auto-filled fields
- [ ] Highlights confidence levels for parsed data
- [ ] Graceful fallback when parsing fails

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Required
```json
{
  "react-native-voice": "^3.2.4",
  "expo-av": "~14.2.0",
  "expo-permissions": "~15.1.0"
}
```

**Note:** Speech-to-text functionality requires either:
- `react-native-voice` for cross-platform online STT
- Native integration with Google MLKit (Android) / iOS Speech API for higher accuracy
- Expo custom dev client or prebuild (not compatible with Expo Go)

### Components to Create

#### 1. VoiceInputModal.tsx
- Recording interface with visual feedback
- Start/stop recording controls
- Audio waveform visualization
- Processing status indicators

#### 2. VoiceButton.tsx
- Floating action button with microphone icon
- Press-and-hold or tap-to-record modes
- Loading states and permissions handling

#### 3. TransactionPreview.tsx
- Display parsed transaction data
- Edit capabilities for each field
- Confidence indicators
- Apply/Cancel actions

### Utility Functions

#### speechParser.ts
```typescript
interface VoiceParseResult {
  amount?: string;
  type?: 'income' | 'expense';
  categoryHints?: string[];
  description?: string;
  date?: string;
  confidence: number;
}

function parseVietnameseTransaction(text: string): VoiceParseResult
function extractAmount(text: string): { amount: string; confidence: number }
function extractAmountWithCurrency(text: string): { amount: string; confidence: number } // Supports "ngh√¨n", "tri·ªáu"
function extractTransactionType(text: string): 'income' | 'expense' | null // Keywords: "received", "added", "spent", "bought"
function extractCategoryHints(text: string): string[]
function extractDescription(text: string): string
function extractDateTime(text: string): string | null // Supports "yesterday", "this morning", etc.
```

### Store Updates

#### transactionDraftStore.ts
```typescript
// Add bulk update method
setBulkFields: (fields: Partial<TransactionDraft>) => void
setFromVoiceInput: (voiceData: VoiceParseResult) => void
```

## üé® UI/UX Design

### Voice Button Design
- **Position**: Floating action button below amount input
- **Icon**: üé§ microphone with subtle pulse animation
- **States**: Default, Recording, Processing, Success, Error
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver support with audio feedback

### Recording Modal Design
- **Layout**: Full-screen overlay with dark background
- **Visual**: Large waveform or circular pulse animation
- **Controls**: Large stop button, cancel button
- **Feedback**: Real-time audio level visualization

### Parsing Results Design
- **Layout**: Card-based preview of extracted data
- **Fields**: Amount, Category, Description with edit icons
- **Confidence**: Color-coded confidence indicators
- **Actions**: Apply, Edit, Cancel buttons

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Speech recognition accuracy**: Implement confidence thresholds and manual fallback
- **Vietnamese language support**: Test with native speakers, provide manual edit option
- **Device compatibility**: Graceful degradation for older devices
- **Permissions**: Clear permission prompts and fallback flows
- **Online/Offline trade-offs**: MVP relies on internet connectivity; Post-MVP offline engines may have reduced accuracy but provide offline functionality

### UX Risks
- **Noisy environments**: Visual indicators for recording quality
- **Privacy concerns**: Clear indication when recording, local processing emphasis
- **Learning curve**: Progressive disclosure and helpful hints

---

## üîí Privacy & Legal Compliance

### Data Handling
- **Audio Data**: Voice recordings are processed by external APIs (Google/Apple) during MVP phase
- **User Consent**: Explicit opt-in required before sending voice data off-device
- **Data Retention**: Audio data is not stored locally or remotely after processing
- **Offline Processing**: Post-MVP phase will implement on-device STT to eliminate external data sharing

### Legal Compliance
- **Vietnam Decree 13/2023**: Voice data is classified as sensitive personal data
- **User Disclosure**: Clear notification when voice data is sent to external services
- **Consent Management**: Users can revoke voice input permissions at any time
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary audio segments are processed, no background recording

### Privacy Controls
- **Settings Toggle**: Allow users to disable voice input entirely
- **Processing Indicator**: Visual feedback when audio is being sent to external APIs
- **Fallback Option**: Manual text input always available as alternative
